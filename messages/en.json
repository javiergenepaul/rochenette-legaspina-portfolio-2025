        "1": "Iâ€™m Rochenette Legaspina, a UI/UX designer from the Philippines with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering. My design approach combines creativity with a focus on user-centered solutions. My journey into UI/UX design began in college, where I joined a student organization passionate about the gaming industry. I started as a 3D modeler, then expanded my skills to 3D texturing and retopology, which sparked my fascination with the technical aspects of design. A pivotal moment was meeting a mentor who introduced me to UI/UX design. Inspired by their guidance, I shifted my focus to creating functional and visually compelling user interfaces and experiences.",

Seeking a broader understanding of the development process, I later worked as a Systems Analyst, collaborating closely with clients and team members. This role helped me bridge the gap between design and development, with the goal of creating designs that are both visually appealing and purpose-driven, solving real user problems."

        "challenge": "Food delivery apps often face issues with cluttered interfaces, which can overwhelm users and make it difficult to find what they need quickly. Navigating between different services, such as ordering food and scheduling transportation, can be confusing and cause frustration. Many users also report difficulties in tracking their orders in real-time, leading to uncertainty about delivery times. Providing accurate and detailed information about delivery times, food items, and service options can be challenging with limited space on mobile screens. Additionally, ensuring consistency in service quality and delivery reliability can be a hurdle when managing a variety of third-party partners.",
        "solution": "To overcome these challenges, I focused on simplifying the appâ€™s design and creating a user-friendly experience for both food delivery and transportation services. I introduced clear, easily navigable sections for each service, reducing clutter and improving access to information. Real-time tracking was integrated, providing users with live updates about their food delivery or transportation status. The interface was optimized for mobile devices, ensuring that users could quickly view and select their options without feeling overwhelmed. By consolidating food delivery and transportation services under a unified platform, the app offers a seamless experience that saves time and improves satisfaction."
