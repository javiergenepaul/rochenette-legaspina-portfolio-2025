        "1": "Iâ€™m Rochenette Legaspina, a UI/UX designer from the Philippines with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering. My design approach combines creativity with a focus on user-centered solutions. My journey into UI/UX design began in college, where I joined a student organization passionate about the gaming industry. I started as a 3D modeler, then expanded my skills to 3D texturing and retopology, which sparked my fascination with the technical aspects of design. A pivotal moment was meeting a mentor who introduced me to UI/UX design. Inspired by their guidance, I shifted my focus to creating functional and visually compelling user interfaces and experiences.",
        "2": "After graduating, I gained real-world experience as a UI/UX designer at a software company. Seeking a broader understanding of the development process, I later worked as a Systems Analyst, collaborating closely with clients and team members. This role helped me bridge the gap between design and development, with the goal of creating designs that are both visually appealing and purpose-driven, solving real user problems."
